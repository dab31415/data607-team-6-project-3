We have grown from $0 to hundreds of millions in dollars deposited through word of mouth and referrals. Yotta is backed by world-class investors like Base10, Core Innovation Capital, YCombinator, Slow Ventures, Ken Moelis, and Cliff Asness. Yotta was recently featured in Bloomberg. 40% of Americans are unable to come up with $400 in an emergency, yet the average household spends $640/year on the lottery, despite the lottery being the worst economic value proposition there is. Why does this dichotomy exist? Because playing the lottery is instantly gratifying and saving isn't. We are making saving money instantly gratifying so that people can get the long term benefit. Our first product is Yotta Savings, a savings account that gives savers the chance to win exciting prizes on a weekly basis through a gamified sweepstakes. We were inspired by Premium Bonds, a program in the UK that works the exact same way and has over $100 billion in deposits from over 1/3 of the British population. This concept has been hugely successful in every country it's been tried in, but it was illegal in the U.S until 2015. We believe that in the next 10 years, Americans will save hundreds of billions of dollars in prize-linked savings accounts. What we're looking forWe are looking for a world-class data scientist to help us drive data-driven product and growth insights that can take Yotta to new heights. We are extremely data-driven in our decision making as a company and are constantly running experiments to try to optimize every part of the app and the funnel. Given the gamification aspect of Yotta, there is a LOT of fun stuff to experiment with. We need someone to help run, analyze, and come up with experiments and dig into data to derive insights that will drive key strategic decisions for the company from both a product and growth perspective. As an early employee you would have the opportunity to shape key decisions for the bank of the future. Banking is one of the last industries to be disrupted by technology so there will be no shortage of hard problems to solve as we grow.

You’ll iterate quickly on challenging and interesting technical problems. How can we turn an autocaptured dataset of millions of events into quantifiable insights? How can we automatically identify frustrating aspects of a customer’s product? How can we help our clients avoid overfitting, and protect them from being fooled by confounding factors? As Heap’s second data scientist, you’ll work directly with our CTO and alongside an expert data scientist and engineer on a fast-moving team.

If you can describe yourself as the powerful combination of data hacker, analyst, communicator, and advisor, our Data Specialist position is the right one for you. As a savvy liaison for our teams, you will create solutions and provide actionable insights that shape the future of our business. The Advisory Data Scientist role is for quantitatively adept people with accompanying business skills. A solid foundation typically in statistics, modeling, operations research, computer science, applications, and math. What sets the data scientist apart is strong business acumen, coupled with the ability to communicate findings to both business and IT leaders in a way that can influence how an organization approaches a business challenge. Advisory Data Scientists will not just address business problems, they will pick the right problems that have the most value to the organization. The Advisory Data Scientist is effective at deploying an analytics solution, thereby realizing business value. Whereas a traditional data analyst may look only at data from a single source – a CRM system, for example – a Advisory Data Scientist will most likely explore and examine data from multiple disparate sources.

The Advisory Data Scientist relies heavily on ‘Thought Leadership’ to listen to a stakeholder’s business strategy or challenge and create an enterprise vision and solution. Their leadership skills are then leveraged to assemble a collaborative team and guide them throughout a transformation program. The transformational program would include the identification and collection of data, the build of statistical models and “what if” analyses, and the iteration of informed insights and conclusions. The Advisory Data Scientist is accountable for the successful communication and acceptance of business results to the stakeholder. Minimum 12+ years of experience: Working with executive level leadership on creating enterprise business strategy and data-driven solutions.Being accountable for conveying successful storytelling, visualization and dashboarding to win the hearts and minds of stakeholders.Leading diverse teams on broad initiatives that realize value throughout the life-cycle of a program (manipulating data sets, building statistical models, using advanced machine learning algorithms for large data sets, iterating on predictive insights, creating roadmaps from as-is to future-state, developing on-going improvement).Sharing experiential knowledge of multiple analytical techniques (regression, simulation, scenario analysis, modeling, clustering, decision trees, neural networks).Leveraging open-source distributed data processing frameworks and utilizing Information Retrieval and relevant tools.Presenting complex data science processes/information to non-data scientists.Influencing the direction and learning plan for the data science profession.

The underpinning of this value exchange relies on having an independent auditing, measurement and optimization layer to power the transaction between the advertiser and publisher. Today the industry standard tools for advertising and media measurement and optimization are usually designed where increased personalization, higher advertising return on investment and increased publisher revenues often comes with negative trade off for consumer privacy or security risks of leaking private data. We envision a world where this doesn't have to be the case - a world where consumer privacy, security, and governance are incorporated into the fabric of the codebase while enabling the necessary business use-cases to effectively keep the world’s information and content free for everyone.

We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world, while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines. About The Team At Roku, the Data Science team lives and works on a kind of frontier: We get called in for things that haven't been done before. This requires meaningful collaboration with the platform team, the firmware team and even the finance team to prove or disprove new product ideas. Often the idea evolves from what was first proposed until it is a wholly new thing that gets shipped. No one here is ashamed to present their latest work, and you'll find yourself pitching ideas to others in the company, including to executives. Beyond collaboration, we seek builders with the persistence to keep pushing. Because we spend our time making prototypes and testing brand new ideas on systems with a lot of moving parts, we are faced with failures every day. The only way to really make something work is to really dig into the reasons and understand why. We value the grit and persistence it takes to keep just trying. About The Role Roku pioneered TV streaming and continues to innovate and lead the industry. The Roku Channel has us well-positioned to help shape the future of streaming. Continued success relies on investing in Data Science and diving deep into the economics of our business. This role is right for you if you enjoy diving into messy data, cleaning it up, finding powerful insights, presenting them in a compelling way, developing models and then working closely with software engineers to automate this process, to prove it out at scale.

The successful candidate will display a balance of hard and soft skills, including the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs. What You’ll Be Doing Develop data science algorithms to improve user experience on Roku’s platform. Develop economic models (e.g., market design, pricing, program evaluation, and forecasting) to better understand the user experience on Roku’s platform. Run live experiments to prototype the improvements and prove their efficacy. Dive into data, clean it up, and pull-out insights that can be used to improve system performance and present to senior leaders with recommendations on business actions. Assist the development team with productization of successful algorithms, ensuring your work continues to drive value at scale. Provide expert consultative assistance to other teams in the company, including data scientists working in other areas of Roku’s stack and provide technical feedback on their econometric work.

We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams.

In short, at Roku you’ll be part of a company that’s changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of.

Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is natural part of the workday.

You tell us a little about yourself, and we use proprietary predictive technology to deliver groceries and recipes that best suit your individual needs and goals. We also assist with meal planning and nutritional support, helping you save time, save money, shop sustainably, and eat what makes you feel your best. We are a distributed team built on top talent from over 10 states across the U.S. While we have an office in NYC, we support employees creating “offices” wherever they are. We believe in fostering team connection and collaboration across all of our “offices” - so don’t expect to be online at 6 am to make a meeting if you’re on the West coast. Expect to attend regular team building events, and to be able to work from the beach every once in a while. Expect to be treated like an owner who cares about our common goal, not someone who has to clock in and out of work.

What You’ll Do We’re hiring a Data Scientist, Personalization to advance the ways that Hungryroot delivers personalized groceries and recipes to customers every week. Today Hungryroot sends hundreds of thousands of groceries each week to customers across the country, each with their own flavor preferences, dietary restrictions, and food occasion needs. Our algorithm takes in all of these signals and balances them against our inventory of delicious, perishable food products and customers’ love for variety in what they eat. The algorithm is at the center of what enables us to be our customers' personal grocery shopper and has driven the 7x growth we've had in the past year. We learn about each customer’s taste via explicit signals like their preference for how often they receive an individual item and their star ratings of recipes, as well as implicit signals like their retention and weekly spend. There are big opportunities for advancing the algorithm, including identifying other predictive implicit signals via regressions, collecting new explicit signals from customers, leveraging collaborative filtering, and more. We then leverage that data in a combination of integer programming, logistic regression models, and factorization machine models. This role will primarily be focused on developing predictive models to enable our broader algorithm to choose groceries and recipes that each customer is likely to love. You'll collaborate with the engineering team to productionize your models. And you'll work with the product team to design A/B tests of the models in production to arrive at the optimal application of your models.
